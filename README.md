# ZX_Spectrum_diy

All boards that I designed, etched and soldered to create a full-diy replica of ZX Spectrum.
**Kicad4** (just a keyboard) and **Kicad5**

This is NOT a cycle-perfect replica so do not expect to launch fancy demos on it. 
The project started as a breadboard simplest possible computer using Z80. Quite quickly I started thinking of making a replica of ZX Spectrum - the first computer I ever used as a kid. All I wanted was to:

- launch Knight Lore - the best game ever
- write some Basic programs - to feel the magic of programming again - and I did!
